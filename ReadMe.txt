Assignment 2 - ADT and TDD - XML Parser

In the program we have created our own StackADT and our own QueueADT, from there we created working versions
of MyArrayList, MyDLL, MyStack, and MyQueue. These working utility classes are then used to implement a XML
Parser that will read and confirm that XML files are properly formatted.

The program is complete in it's functionality = 100%.

How to run:
Navigate to the runnable jar file located within the folder in the project via command line. 
Enter in the name of the text file you wish to read.
ie)java -jar Parser.jar C:/CPRG311/sample2.xml
